## About WeightsLab
WeightsLab is a powerful tool for editing and inspecting data & AI models.

### What Problems Does It Solve?
WeightsLab addresses critical AI research challenges:

* Dataset insights & optimization
* Overfitting and training plateau
* Over/Under parameterization

### Key Capabilities
The granular statistics and interactive paradigm enable powerful workflows:

* Monitor granular insights on data samples, signals, and weight parameters
* Use the AI agent to:
  * Create slices of data and discard them for the next training iteration
  * Discard low-quality samples from training data
  * Iterative pruning or growing of the architectures (INCOMING feature)
